# ubc-farm monorepo

## Installation

1. Install Node.JS and NPM
2. Clone this package
3. Run `npm install` in the package root
4. Run `npm run bootstrap`

## Running the server

Run the `serve` script. This can be achived by one of these commands:
1. Running `npm run serve`
2. Running `lerna run serve`
3. Navigating to `packages/server/` and then running `npm run serve`

All of the commands do the same thing, but 3 will run a bit faster.
